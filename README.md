# Work-Day-Scheduler
Challenge-5

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Usage

This is a daily work day planner to create a schedule. When i open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. By scrolling down we can see timeblocks for standard business hours.When i view the timeblocks for that day then each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When you click into a timeblock you can enter an event and also you can click the save button for that timeblock.The text for that event is saved in the local storage. The events persist even after you refresh the page.
